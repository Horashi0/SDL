Hi, this is my repository to learn SDL. I like to code in C so 
SDL seems a fun way to learn C whilst creating cool stuff

I am following this tutorial: https://www.parallelrealities.co.uk/tutorials/shooter/shooter1.php

File structure:
- common.h - contains common headers.
- defs.h - contains definitions, such as the size of the window.
- draw.c - functions related to drawing and rendering.
- draw.h - header file for draw.c.
- init.c - functions concerned with setting up SDL.
- init.h - header file for init.c.
- input.c - handles input, such as reading the keyboard.
- input.h - header file for input.c.
- main.c - where the main loop and program entry point exists.
- main.h - header file for main.c.
- structs.h - object definitions.
